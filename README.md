# Regression Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the Regression Machine Learning Repository! This repository showcases expertise in regression machine learning techniques, covering various aspects such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model development. It demonstrates the application of linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression, alongside hyperparameter tuning and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The goal is to ensure accurate predictions and optimize model performance.


## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Demonstrates techniques for cleaning and preprocessing raw data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the dataset's characteristics, distributions, correlations, and potential relationships between variables.

- **Feature Selection**: Implements feature selection methods to identify the most relevant features for regression modeling, improving model interpretability and performance.

- **Model Development**: Utilizes various regression techniques, including linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression, to build predictive models for continuous target variables.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search or randomized search, to optimize model performance and generalization ability.
